    // 1) removed the backticks - JSON does not read backticks
    // 2) deleted the invalidBookingJSON declaration - that is only for JavaScript to read
    // 3) added a comma to checkInDate - JSON will give a syntax error
    // 4) added quotations in the name key for Alice Johnson - even keys need to be in strings
    // 5) change the value from undefined to null - JSON doesn't read undefined
    // 6) deleted the trailing comma in the array of amenities. - it invalid in JSON to have extra commas

/*
üí¨ Reflect and answer the following:

1Ô∏è‚É£ What tools or techniques did you use to identify the errors?  First I looked at the code to see if there were any obvious mistakes, and then looked for any syntax errors within the VS codes error handling and made sure I didn't have anymore red lines under the code.

2Ô∏è‚É£ How did you confirm that your corrected JSON file was valid? I used the Code Beautify website and pasted the code to comfirm it was valid

3Ô∏è‚É£ Which errors were the most difficult to spot? Why? In this particular example locating the errors were not too difficult, but when creating my own JSON object file, I had trouble with extra curly braces

4Ô∏è‚É£ What strategies can help you avoid these kinds of errors in the future? I felt that formating would be a big one, just to keep all the curly braces and brackets in line and closing on the correct objects or arrays.
   (e.g., syntax highlighting, linters, writing JSON by example)
